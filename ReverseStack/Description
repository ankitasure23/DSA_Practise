Problem Statement: You are given a stack of integers. Your task is to reverse the stack using recursion. You may only use standard stack operations (push, pop, top/peek, isEmpty). You are not allowed to use any loop constructs or additional data structures like arrays or queues.

Your solution must modify the input stack in-place to reverse the order of its elements.
