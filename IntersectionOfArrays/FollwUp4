What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

If both arrays are sorted, I would use the two-pointer technique and stream nums2 from disk sequentially. This avoids loading the entire array into memory and only requires constant extra space.

If arrays are not sorted:

I would sort nums2 using external sorting first, then apply two pointers
